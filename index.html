<p>I have not updated this site for a long time.  I mostly use other websites now but may update this at some indeterminate point in the future.  I've had this domain for a long time, it's not like some famous ngo or non-profit.  It's mostly used for email routing.</p>

<p>Here is a video for your entertainment that may or may not relate to reality: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z02Y54Ce3U">pusa mach5</a> and a little background on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Presidents_of_the_United_States_of_America_(band)">defunct band</a> which is semi-related to some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_Racer">manga magic</a>.  It also may or may not be related to the name of this website, which may or may not've been around longer than <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/TheLastWebPage.html">everything else on the internet</a>, or perhaps you just found an edge in the graph?</a>

<p>Most of these are quite old, I switched to using other platforms a while back.  There's probably a few thousand photos other places.  Apologies, many of them ended up in the walled garden of facebook/instagram/etc.</p>
