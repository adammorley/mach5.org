<p>I have not updated this site for a long time.  I mostly use other websites now but may update this at some indeterminate point in the future.  I've had this domain for a long time, it's not like some famous ngo or non-profit.</p>

<p>Most of these are quite old, I switched to using other platforms a while back.  There's probably a few thousand photos other places.  Apologies, many of them ended up in the walled garden of facebook/instagram/etc.</p>
