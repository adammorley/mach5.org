<title>Travel in Denmark</title>
<h2>Berlin - 2004-03-30</h2>
<hr>

<p>
I traveled to Berlin on a DIS "field trip" aka vacation around the end of March.  This (thankfully) meant that my time in Berlin was much warmer than Stockholm.  I must highly recommend a visit to Berlin, as it's historical significance alone warrants a visit.  Berlin, however, is changing very quickly.  For this reason, the sooner the visit, the better.

In a way, Berlin was a welcome change to Denmark.  As much as I love Denmark, the shops close rather early.  This was definately not the case in Berlin.  I was walking around just before midnight, and shops were open all over the place, people were out and about.  Definately different.  Public transit, as usual, was efficient, plentiful and quick.  The city offered many options for exploration, only a few of which are actually below.  After all, time was limited (only four days).

We started off by bus, headed for the ferry from Denmark to Germany.
