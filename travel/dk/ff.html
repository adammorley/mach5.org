<h2>French Fries</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Sometimes I don't plan ahead when leaving school and end up waiting a bit at the train station.  I've found that passing the time eating french fries is quite tasty.

A ketchup packet.  I count 14 languages.  Danish, Greek, Finnish, Sweedish, English (British), Norweigan, Romanian, Dutch (?), French, ?, Hungarian (?), Slovak, ?, ? (if you know them to be different, please let me know, I'm interested).

The first two times I ordered in McDonalds, I felt it would be practical to use English.  I asked for a small french fry, paid 9 Kroner (+ .50 for the ketchup), and went on my merry way.  The third time, I was adventurous -- I ordered in Danish.  Or so I thought.  "Jeg skal have en lille french fry, tak."  (I am going to have a small french fry, thanks)  Turns out, I got a small fountain drink, a Fanta.  Think McDonalds orange drink, but with carbonation.  I found this rather odd, but the place was loud, and I was somewhat in a hurry, so I decided to try the mysterious orange drink.  Good, but the french fries were far better.  The second try in Danish, I cheated and looked at the value menu outside the McDonalds.  A small french fry was listed as "en lille pommes frites," which seemed odd, because that was not the word I remembered for potatoes.  I couldn't remember what the word was at the time.  So I ordered.

"Jeg skal have en lille pommes frites, tak" and I magically got a small french fry and something about ketchup or mayonaise.  I naturally replied ketchup, gave my ti Kroner, got my fifty ore, and went on my way.  Later that evening I asked my host family about it.  Apparently, the Danes, in their normally smart fashion, say potato in French.  "Les pommes" -- the potatoes.  Many things are like that in Denmark, just well thought out or otherwise quite "smart" as the Brits would say.
