<title>Travel in Denmark</title>
<h2>Denmark</h2
<hr>

<p>
This is mostly a page about travel in Denmark and other trips during my time in Denmark.
</p>
<p>
The pages are in, effectively, chronological order, ie: the order follows where I went.  I didn't bother with dates.  Look at the pictures and what people are wearing.  That should be a clue.
</p>

<p>
I should also say that <a href="http://krak.dk/">this</a> site has amazing maps of Denmark that are clickable and just plain great.  I have no idea if they have an English page, as I just use it in Danish.  Kort means map (it also means short, which Ole had to remind me of recently).
</p>

<p>
Fair warning.  While in Europe I took in the neighborhood of six thousand images.  No where near all of them are on these pages, but it is still quite a . . . trip for you desk travelers.  Up to Stockholm, I've been averaging one in every five to one in every ten pictures on this site.
