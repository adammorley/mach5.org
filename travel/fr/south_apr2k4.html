<title>The south of France</title>
<h2>The Riviera, Provence, exotic French locales, etc.</h2>
<hr>

<p>
During my spring break, I took a little trip to the south of France.  My parents (who <a href="../dk/parents.html">visited me in Denmark</a>) were exploring the French Riviera (their first trip to Europe) after seeing Paris.  They had a fancy hotel room that cost ungodly sums of money (but that they were paying very little for, my mother is quite good at such things) so I couldn't resist the opportunity to see the sights.

<img src="pics/south_apr2k4/pict1345.jpg"><p>It really does look exactly like in movies, and pictures.  It was so odd to see it in real life.  Typical French driving abounded --- meaning you would often see people drifting across the center line at corners hoping to pass on the next straight.  I made a low-quality <a href="pics/pict1353.mov">movie</a> of the driving.  Turn the sound down, as it's ungodly scratchy.</p>

From Nice/the Riviera, I went to Aix-en-Provence by train via Marseille.  My friend Christina was studying in Aix, and having a tremendously good time.  She lived in an apartment with her roomate, Jane.  Jane is hilarious.
