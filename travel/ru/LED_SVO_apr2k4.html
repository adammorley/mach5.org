<title>Russia: St. Petersburg and Moscow</title>
<h2>Russia: St. Petersburg and Moscow, April 2004</h2>
<hr>

<p>
I visited Russia during the Spring of 2004 with DIS.  We traveled by plane to St. Petersburg, by night train to Moscow and flew back to Copenhagen.  Visas were required.  Russian night trains (we went second class, on night train #1 --- the Red Arrow, not kidding) are quite nice.  Russia proved to be a very odd place to visit, largely a result of the contrast between developed and undeveloped.  Writing this in 2006, I am of the opinion that Russia has more "culture-shock" factor than Africa, largely a result of the stark contrast.  Perhaps it is the order in which I traveled to certain places.  I would love to spend more time in Russia --- it does cover eleven timezones, and simply seeing Moscow and St. Petersburg doesn't really seem like seeing Russia.  Both cities are very European, St. Petersburg more so.
</p>

<p>
We went to St. Petersburg first, and stayed in the <a href="http://www.hotel-moscow.ru">Hotel Moscow</a>, near Alexander Nevsky Square.

<p>
Peter and Paul's fortress in St. Petersburg is home to the bodies of many of Russia's Czars.  Russian churches, palaces and significant builds have so much gold leaf it can make a person's head spin.  I saw Russia's palaces before Versailles, and Russia's palaces made Versailles look like a modest country home for the middle class.  Is it any wonder the average person was not happy in these countries?
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.unilib.neva.ru/city/churches/church01a.html">Peter and Paul's fortress</a> was built on an island in the Neva River delta, in May of 1703.  The rest of St. Petersburg spreads out from there.  The 300 year celebration in St. Petersburg was quite a big deal, and many buildings had been restored for the celebration.

<img src="pics/LED_SVO_apr2k4/pict0991.jpg"><p>While I was on top, it seems that some sort of explosion went off, and large amounts of smoke billowed into the sky.  I never did find out what happened.</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/index.html">Hermitage Museum</a> is near Peter and Paul's fortress.  Inside, it is truly amazing.  The exterior is not exactly shabby either.  Also known as Katrina The Great's winter palace, it is located in Palace Square.  In the square is the Alexander column, erected to commemorate the Russian's victory over Napoleon.

<p>
We headed out the next day, to see Katarina the Great's Summer Palace in Pushkin, outside St. Petersburg.  This is the palace that makes Versailles look like a summer cottage.

<p>
That night, we left St. Petersburg for Moscow.  We went by train, on Russian Night Train #1, called, "Red Arrow."  I thought we had gone first class (it was quite fine), but upon further reading now, it seems that we traveled second class, since we had four bunks in a cabin.

We went inside, where you can see Lenin's body embalmed in a glass case.  There are many turns to get inside, and at the end of each corridor is a guard.  When we were entering, the man in front of our group slipped some money to the guards that search bags.  Photos are not normally allowed.</p>

Hotel Russia is one of the largest hotel in Europe, with "about 3000 rooms.".  It is so large, some of the staff didn't know everything that was inside.  Effectively, with four different entrances, it "feels" like four separate hotels.  The hotel is so large that underneath is a giant go-kart track.  I'm not even kidding.  The staff at our entrance didn't know where it was, but we spotted the sign out our window.  It was the full deal, with crash suits and helmets and gas-powered go-karts.</p>

<img src="pics/LED_SVO_apr2k4/pict1231.jpg"><p>More traffic.  It's more congested in Russia in terms of lanes and number of cars, but the driving style isn't nearly as hap-hazard as the developing world.</p>

<p>
And so ended the trip to Russia.  Admittedly, this page is missing most of the more in-depth, funny and/or interesting stories.  Those are best conveyed verbally.  I did visit the Kremlin and the Bolshoi, but did not take any photos.
</p>

<p>
The Kremlin was not nearly as exciting as I had hoped for, at least after seeing all of the palaces outside St. Petersburg.
</p>

<p>
The Bolshoi, on the other hand, was amazing.  The interior was quite fine, and the curtain with the little hammer and sickle was quite a surprise.
