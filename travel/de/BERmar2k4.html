<p>
I traveled to Berlin with the DIS trip to Berlin, a very organized and educational trip.
</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0519.jpg"><p>We traveled to Berlin via ferry and bus, meaning we got to ride the neat ferry boat that has train tracks on it.  More about that ferry boat on my Denmark pages.</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0535.jpg"><p>We went and dined at the top of the TV Tower in Alexanderplatz.</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0538.jpg"><p>But on the way, there were students protesting tuition increases.</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0540.jpg"><p>At the base of the tower, there are some odd architectural features</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0544.jpg"><p>And the tower, from below</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0549.jpg"><p>One of cool things about the Telecafe is that it rotates --- just like the Space Needle in Seattle.</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0551.jpg"><p>The view is pretty impressive.  My tablemate was a fellow DIS student from Moscow.</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0555.jpg"><p>Definitely cooler at night.</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0559.jpg"><p>What trip to Berlin would be complete without a trip to the dome on the Reichstag?</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0565.jpg"><p>You can even see down into the parliamentary chambers.</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0569.jpg"><p>Though it's much easier at ground level.</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0574.jpg"><p>The Brandenburg Gate, formerly inaccessible during the Cold War</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0577.jpg"><p>The site of the Berlin wall, about 100 meters in front of the gate.</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0581.jpg"><p>Let's go to Europe and do a little sightseeing.  The funny thing is the Starbucks drinker is a German.</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0588.jpg"><p>One of the largest remaining pieces of the Berlin Wall.</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0591.jpg"><p>Apples in the entry of a church?</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0594.jpg"><p>Memorial church in central Berlin.</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0618.jpg">
<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0620.jpg">
<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0621.jpg"><p>I stumbled upon great food and a break-dancing show near the church.</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0626.jpg">
<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0627.jpg"><p>What's wrong with this picture?</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0638.jpg"><p>Niels, one of the Danish instructors who came along for the trip</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0641.jpg"><p>Surplus Soviet-era souvenirs near Checkpoint Charlie</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0657.jpg"><p>Random public art near Checkpoint Charlie</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0658.jpg">
<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0661.jpg"><p>The former East Germany, complete with SmartCar.</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0664.jpg"><p>Who loves SmartCars?</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0666.jpg"><p>An escalator in a supermarket, but one that is a ramp.  It has no stairs.  It's quite functional for carts, but hold on!</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0674.jpg"><p>I went up in a balloon to see the city from above.</p>

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0682.jpg"><p>Potsdamer Platz and the Sony Center.</p>

<p>
Potsdamer Platz was famously split by the Berlin wall.  A <a href="http://www.fkoester.de/kreiten/img/potsdamer_platz_1919.jpg">photo</a> from before the Cold war shows the major intersection.  During the war, another <a href="http://www.dailysoft.com/berlinwall/photographs/berlinwall-60s/berlinwall-60s_005.htm">photo</a> shows how much the intersection changed.  Today, a small piece of the Berlin wall remains, and traffic has returned.  The underground tunnels have been re-connected, and the trains run through both parts of the city.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdamer_Platz">Wikipedia</a> has an entry on Potsdamer Platz.

<img src="pics/BERmar2k4/wict0781.jpg"><p>On our way back to Copenhagen, we visited Sachsenhausen, a Nazi Concentration Camp 40km north of Berlin.  Tens of thousands of people died here during its operation before World War II, during, and later when the camp was used as a gulag during communist times.  More information on Sachsenhausen is available from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachsenhausen_concentration_camp">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
